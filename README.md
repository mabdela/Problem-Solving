# Problem-Solving
This repository contains problems covering fundamental topics in computer programming. The questions are mainly obtained from LeetCode and the HackerRank online computer programming practice problems. 
The programming problems are completed using the Python and the Java programming languages. The problems solved using the python programming languages are completed using Jupyter Notebook. Several problems covering a given concept are included in each Jupyter Notebooks. The topics covered are outlined as follows:


· Data structures — at a minimum, make sure you know how to work with and are comfortable talking about Arrays (2D/3D), Linked Lists/Reverse Linked Lists (Space vs Time), Hash Tables, Stacks, Queues, Heaps and Binary Trees. Be able to talk about the underlying mechanics of the data structure.

·         Object Oriented Design – Understand how to conceptually break a program down into objects that work together to create a solution.

·         Sorting and Searching — Know the most efficient type of search for the input given to the search.

·         Trees (binary/red black trees/N-ary trees, tree symmetric (inverse image), tree traversal, sorting trees)

·         Recursion/Recursive strings

·         Graphs/Graph traversal
