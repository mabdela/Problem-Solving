# Problem-Solving
This repository contains problems covering fundamental topics in computer programming. The questions are mainly obtained from LeetCode and the HackerRank online computer programming practice problems. 
The programming problems are completed using Python and Java. The problems solved using the python programming languages are completed using Jupyter Notebook. Several problems covering the given concept are included in each Jupyter Notebook. The topics covered are outlined as follows:


#### Data structures 
  - [Arrays (2D/3D) and Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/mubarekabdela/Problem-Solving/tree/master/ArraysAndDynamicProgramming)
  - Linked Lists/Reverse Linked Lists (Space vs Time), 
  - Hash Tables
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Heaps
  - Binary Trees
#### Object Oriented Design
#### Sorting
#### Searching
#### Recursion/Recursive strings
#### Graphs/Graph traversal
